### Quadratic Funding Bonus

Your donation will be matched from the matching pool based on the QF formula:

```
Match = (√donation₁ + √donation₂ + ... + √donationₙ)² - Total Donations
```

**Example:**
- 10 people donate 1 ETH each = 10 ETH raised
- QF match = (√1 × 10)² - 10 = 100 - 10 = **90 ETH match!**

## Understanding Quadratic Funding

### What is Quadratic Funding?

QF is a democratic way to fund public goods that:
- Values the **number of contributors** over donation size
- Matches small donations more generously
- Prevents wealthy donors from dominating
- Encourages community participation

### How It Works

1. **Donation Phase:** People donate to projects
2. **Matching Calculation:** QF formula calculates matches
3. **Distribution:** Matching funds distributed from pool
4. **Results:** Projects with broad support get more matching

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario A: Many Small Donors**
- 100 donors × $10 = $1,000 raised
- QF match ≈ $9,000
- **Total: $10,000**

**Scenario B: One Large Donor**
- 1 donor × $1,000 = $1,000 raised
- QF match ≈ $0
- **Total: $1,000**

**Winner:** Scenario A gets 10x more total funding!
